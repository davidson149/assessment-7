The patterns that are seen here by both insert and append is enough to notice a difference between both methods that are incremental.
Insert seems to be slower in that as we get to the larger array it gets up to the seconds category and doesnt even stay in the milliseconds. For a function that gets significantly slower its not one that scales very well. Where as the append method is consistent to scale and only gets to the miliseconds. Which is considerably better than the insert method.
Out of the two the append method is prefered and i would use to sort an array.
